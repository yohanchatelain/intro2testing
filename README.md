# Software testing and continuous integration tutorial

Base repo for teaching testing at [BrainHack Montreal 2023](https://brainhackmtl.github.io/global2023/)

## Material

This tutorial is based on Greg Kiar's work [here](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/testing/) BrainHack 2020
that FranÃ§ois Paugam extended for BrainHack 2022

This project extends the original tutorial with the use of `pytest` and GitHub action.
The project structure has been reorganized to be used with `pytest`.
The original scripts used by Greg in his video are located in `best_science_ever` if you want to reproduce the experiments Greg shows in his video.

### Warning

Greg uses Travis-CI.org to do the remote tests on his GitHub repo. 
Since 2021 Travis-CI.org no longer exists, there is only the commercial Travic-CI.com. 
So instead we will here use GitHub actions. 
Thus you can follow the video up until 55:23, then follow the instructions below to set up the GitHub action workflow.


## Installation

### Requirements

You need `git` and `python>=3.8` installed.
If you want to work in an isolated environment, you can work in the following docker image

```bash
docker pull python:3.10
docker run -it python:3.10 /bin/bash
```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yohanchatelain/intro2testing
```

### Create a virtual environment

If you don't want to mess up your current setup

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment named brainhack-tutorial-ci
python3 -m venv brainhack-tutorial-ci
# Activate the environment 
source brainhack-tutorial-ci/bin/activate
```

### Install the package

Have a look at `pyproject.toml` that configures the project and install the dependencies

```bash
pip install .
```

### Run the tests

Run the tests located in `best_science_ever/tests/test_best_science_ever.py`.
Add `-v` to enable verbose mode.

```bash
pytest -v
```

All the tests should pass except last one mimicking `Test 2` in `best_science_ever/test.sh`

#### Fixing the bug

1. Try to understand the issue.
   <details>
   <summary> Answer </summary>
    
    The output from the `diff` command shows a difference between `test_data.csv` and `test_data_0_processed.csv`. Specifically, the processed file (`test_data_0_processed.csv`) includes an additional, unnamed column at the beginning. This additional column appears to be the index of the DataFrame being saved to the CSV file.

    This issue typically occurs when saving a DataFrame to a CSV file in Pandas without specifying that the index should not be included. By default, pandas' `to_csv` method includes the DataFrame index as the first column in the CSV file.

2. Fix the bug.
   <details>
   <summary> Answer </summary>

    To fix this, you can modify the `to_csv` call in your `best_science_ever.py` script to include the argument `index=False`. This will prevent pandas from writing the index to the CSV file. The modified line in the `main()` function should look like this:

    ```python
    ndf.to_csv(tmp_dfs[0].replace(".csv", f"_{_idx}_processed.csv"), index=False)
    ```

    And for the case where `new_df` is not a list:

    ```python
    new_df.to_csv(tmp_dfs[0].replace(".csv", "_processed.csv"), index=False)
    ```

    With this modification, the saved CSV files will not include the DataFrame index, and the structure of the output files should match that of the input file more closely.
